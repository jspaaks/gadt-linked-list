   C     is quirky, flawed,     and an enormous    success. Although     accidents of history     surely helped, it evidently     satisfied a need

   for a system implementation    language efficient enough          to displace assembly language,  
   yet sufficiently abstract  and fluent to describe
  algorithms and      interactions in    a wide variety
of environments                       --       Dennis      M.    Ritchie
